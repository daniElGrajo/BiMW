# BiMW
Some coding tools developed during my PhD.

All the content is ordered with the next structure:
1. Section with Matlab, octave and python scripts for solving the trascendental self-consistency equation for slab waveguides.
2. Section with simulation scripts for photon design v1.6. This includes the design of single mode rib waveguides, bimodal rib waveguides, all of them in Si3N4. Other elements included are the designs for vertical tapers and other structures.
3. Section with OO programing scripts in python and GDSPY to build the masks.
4. Section with Labview software used for detection. (Strong collaboration with Dr. David Fari√±a and Dra. Stefania Dante).
5. Section with software for post-processing data from modal interferometric optical signals, with a chirp modulation and with tools to post-process and plot in iPython Notebooks.
